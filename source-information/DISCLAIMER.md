# Eat Out to Help Out Restaurant Map - Disclaimer

> TL;DR: If a restaurant is listed on this map, it is ***not a guarantee*** that it is participating in the Eat Out to Help Out scheme.

Due to the nature of sourcing this information, there are likely to be some mistakes in the data presented, particularly with regards to chain restaurants (see [SOURCES.md](/source-information/SOURCES.md) for more information about this).

These mistakes are, sadly, unavoidable - they are a result of using automated processes. If automated processes were not used, adding chain restaurants to this map would not have been possible at all. **If you notice a mistake, please open an issue with the details.**

**The contributors to this project and this project's owner ACCEPT NO LIABILITY for any action that takes place as a result of the use of this map. If in doubt as to whether or not a restaurant on this map is participating in the scheme, please contact the restaurant directly.**
